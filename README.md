# ✨ Vibe.AI

> *Is your life utterly devoid of artificial intelligence that can talk back to you?*
> Do you often find yourself staring blankly at a screen, wishing it would just understand your deepest, most mundane queries?
> Well, friend, you've stumbled upon the digital equivalent of a life raft – **Vibe.AI!**

**Vibe.AI** is a cutting-edge (or at least, *gets-the-job-done*) web-based chatbot, powered by the surprisingly competent **Google Gemini API**. It's designed for those who appreciate a sleek interface, seamless interaction, and perhaps a touch of digital companionship when human beings are just too much effort.

## 💡 Why Vibe.AI? (Because why not?)

### 🧠 **Responsive Chat Interface**

Because nobody wants a chatbot that looks like it was designed in the early 2000s.
Our UI is so modern, it probably judges your old browser.

---

### ⚙️ **Gemini API Integration**

We didn't build a supercomputer; Google did.
We just politely ask their fancy AI to answer your questions.
It's surprisingly good at it.

---

### 🎙️ **Voice Mode** *(For the truly lazy or hands-free multitaskers)*

Talk to it. Yes, actually talk to your computer.
It transcribes your mumbled thoughts and even talks back!
Perfect for when typing feels like too much of a commitment.

---

### 🧾 **Dynamic Chat History** *(Because memory is overrated)*

Forget your past conversations? **Vibe.AI** doesn't.
It saves everything locally so you can relive your profound discussions
or just search for that one time you asked it for a pizza recipe.

---

### 🎨 **Theming Options** *(Because aesthetic is everything)*

* **Light mode** for your bright, optimistic days.
* **Dark mode** for your existential crises or just to save your eyeballs at 3 AM.

---

### 🔊 **Sound Effects** *(For that satisfying 'ding!')*

We added little noises because silence is awkward.
Hear a chime when your brilliant query is sent,
and another when the AI delivers its equally brilliant (or at least coherent) reply.

---

### 💻 **Code Block Formatting** *(For the developers and aspiring ones)*

If **Vibe.AI** decides to bless you with code, it'll actually format it nicely.
No more squinting at monospace text.

---

### ⚡ **Quick Replies** *(For when you can't even)*

Can't think of what to say next?
We've got pre-chewed responses ready for you.
You're welcome.

---

### ♿ **Accessibility** *(Because everyone deserves a digital friend)*

We made sure it plays nice with common browser features.
